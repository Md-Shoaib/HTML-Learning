    <title>JavaScript Tutorial: Interaction - Alert, Prompt, Confirm</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is a page</p>

    // Let us start by understanding what is an alert() function. The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It is often used to make sure information comes through to the user. The alert box takes the focus away from the current window and forces the browser and forces the browser to read the message. Do not overuse this method, as it prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.

    // Alert in in-browser Javascript - Does not return anything
    // alert("This is message");

    // The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input. A prompt box is often used if you want to input a value before entering a page. When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value. The prompt() method returns the input value if the user clicks "OK". If the user clicks "cancel" the method returns null.
    // Prompt in JS
    // let name = prompt("What is your name?", "Default Message")
    // console.log(name);

    // The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something. The confirm box takes the focus away from the current window and forces the browser to read the message.  The confirm() method returns true if the user clicked "OK", and false otherwise. This method is only used if we want to double-check any task performed by the user.
    // Confirm in  JS
    let deletePost = confirm("Do you really want to delete your post")
    // console.log(deletePost);

    if (deletePost) {
        // Code to delete the post
        console.log("Your post has been deleted Successfully");
    } else {
        console.log("Your post has been not been deleted");
    }
