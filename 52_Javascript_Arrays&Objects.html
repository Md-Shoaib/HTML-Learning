    // The object class represents one of JavaScriptâ€™s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor. we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference. To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types.

    // primitive
    // let myVar = 34;
    // let myVar = "string";
    // let myVar = true;
    // let myVar = null;
    // let myVar = undefined;

    // Apart from primitive data types, all the other are objects. 
    // In this example, an employee is an object that contains the name, salary, channel, and channel 2 inside it. This is an example, where we create objects manually by us. 
    let employee = {
        name: "Md Shoaib",
        salary: 1000000,
        channel: "StudyWithShoaib",
        "channel 2": "ProgrammintWithShoaib" // This written between quotes because we here use a space
    }
    // console.log(employee);

    // There is a special kind of object known as Arrays. The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. 
    // Array 
    // let names = [1, 2, 4, "Shoaib", undefined];
    // console.log(names);
    // An array can contain any type of value in it whether it is a string, integer, or boolean

    // To print the value present at any index number
    // console.log(names[1]);

    // We can also create arrays with the help of a new keyword
    // let names = new Array(23);
    // In this way, an array will be treated as an object. The new keyword is used to create a new object. To know the length of an array, we can use the length function 
    // console.log(names.length)

    // Declaring new Array
    let names = new Array(41, 2, 4, "Shoaib", undefined);
    // console.log(names);

    // However, to sort this array, we can use sort() function
    names = names.sort;
    console.log(names);
