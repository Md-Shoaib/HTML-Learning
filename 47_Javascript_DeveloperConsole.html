    <!-- We have two options to place the JavaScript in the code. One is in the <head> section and the other is after the <body> tag. But if we view other professional websites, they place their JavaScript at the end of the <body> tag so that the DOM does not get affected -->

    <!-- JavaScript --> 
    <script>
        // Write your js here
        console.log('Hello World');
